# Delete and Earn 

You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

    Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.

Along with the maximum number of points you can earn, return the minimum, and maximum of the numbers you select (not the deleted numbers).

Return the maximum number of points you can earn, the minimum selected number, and the maximum selected number.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: [6, 6, 2, 4]
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points. The selected numbers were 4, 3, and 2, so their sum is 6, min is 2, and max is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: [9, 9, 2, 3]
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points. The selected numbers were 3, 3, 3, so their sum is 9, min is 3, and max is 3.
