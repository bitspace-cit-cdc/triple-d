# Maximum Points you can obtain from cards

You are given an integer array `cardPoints` representing points associated with several cards arranged in a row. You can take exactly `k` cards, either from the beginning or the end.

 You can take at most **`m`** cards from one side (left or right), and the remaining must be taken from the opposite side.

Return the maximum score you can obtain while respecting this constraint.

---

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`cardPoints = [4,2,3,4,5,6,1], k = 3, m = 2`  
**Output:**  
`11`  
**Explanation:**  
- The best strategy is taking 2 cards from the right `[6,1]` and 1 card from the left `[4]`, giving a total score of `6 + 1 + 4 = 11`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`cardPoints = [2,2,2], k = 2, m = 1`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
- You must take 1 card from each side: `[2]` from left and `[2]` from right.

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`cardPoints = [9,7,7,9,7,7,9], k = 7, m = 5`  
**Output:**  
`55`  
**Explanation:**  
- You must take at least 2 from one side and up to 5 from the other, but since `k == len(cardPoints)`, the total sum remains the same.

---

### Constraints:
- `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`
- `1 <= m <= k`




# Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k, int m) {
    int n = cardPoints.size(), max_points = 0;

    for (int left = 0; left <= min(m, k); ++left) {
        int right = k - left;
        if (right > min(m, k)) continue;

        int left_sum = accumulate(cardPoints.begin(), cardPoints.begin() + left, 0);
        int right_sum = (right > 0) ? accumulate(cardPoints.end() - right, cardPoints.end(), 0) : 0;
        
        max_points = max(max_points, left_sum + right_sum);
    }
    
    return max_points;
}

int main() {
    int n, k, m;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> cardPoints(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> cardPoints[i];
    }

    cin >> k >> m;
    cout << maxScore(cardPoints, k, m) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}

```


```python
def maxScore(cardPoints, k, m):
    n = len(cardPoints)
    max_points = 0

    for left in range(min(m, k) + 1):
        right = k - left
        if right > min(m, k):
            continue

        left_sum = sum(cardPoints[:left])
        right_sum = sum(cardPoints[-right:]) if right > 0 else 0
        max_points = max(max_points, left_sum + right_sum)

    return max_points

cardPoints = list(map(int, input().split()))
k, m = map(int, input().split())
print(maxScore(cardPoints, k, m))

```
