# 2Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents a **directed** and **weighted** edge from city `fromi` to city `toi` with weight `weighti`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`, return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most `distanceThreshold`.

If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the **greatest number**.

### **Example 1:**

#### **Input:**

```cpp
n = 4
edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]]
distanceThreshold = 4
```

#### **Output:**

```cpp
3
```

#### **Explanation:**

The directed graph structure:

- `0 → 1 (3)`
- `1 → 2 (1)`
- `1 → 3 (4)`
- `2 → 3 (1)`

The reachable cities at `distanceThreshold = 4`:

- `City 0 -> [City 1]`
- `City 1 -> [City 2, City 3]`
- `City 2 -> [City 3]`
- `City 3 -> []`

Cities `3` have the smallest number of reachable cities, we return **City 3**.

### **Example 2:**

#### **Input:**

```cpp
n = 5
edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]
distanceThreshold = 2
```

#### **Output:**

```cpp
4
```

#### **Explanation:**

The directed graph structure:

- `0 → 1 (2)`
- `0 → 4 (8)`
- `1 → 2 (3)`
- `1 → 4 (2)`
- `2 → 3 (1)`
- `3 → 4 (1)`

The reachable cities at `distanceThreshold = 2`:

- `City 0 -> [City 1]`
- `City 1 -> [City 4]`
- `City 2 -> []`
- `City 3 -> []`
- `City 4 -> []`

City `4` has the smallest number of reachable cities , so we return **City 0**.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int findTheCity(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int distanceThreshold) {
    vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        int from = edge[0], to = edge[1], weight = edge[2];
        dist[from][to] = weight;
    }

    for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (dist[i][k] != INT_MAX && dist[k][j] != INT_MAX) {
                    dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    int minNeighbors = INT_MAX, bestCity = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i != j && dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count < minNeighbors || (count == minNeighbors && i > bestCity)) {
            minNeighbors = count;
            bestCity = i;
        }
    }
    return bestCity;
}

int main() {
    int n, m, distanceThreshold;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<vector<int>> edges(m, vector<int>(3));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        cin >> edges[i][0] >> edges[i][1] >> edges[i][2];
    }

    cin >> distanceThreshold;
    cout << findTheCity(n, edges, distanceThreshold) << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

    min_neighbors = float('inf')
    best_city = -1

    for i in range(n):
        count = sum(1 for j in range(n) if i != j and dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold)
        if count < min_neighbors or (count == min_neighbors and i > best_city):
            min_neighbors = count
            best_city = i

    return best_city


n = int(input().strip())

edges = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
distanceThreshold = int(input().strip())
print(findTheCity(n, edges, distanceThreshold))
