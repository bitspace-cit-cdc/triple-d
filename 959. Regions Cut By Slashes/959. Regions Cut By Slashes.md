# 959. Regions Cut By Slashes

An `n x n` grid is composed of `1 x 1` squares where each `1 x 1` square consists of a `'/'`, `'\'`, `'X'`, or blank space `' '`. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

- The character `'/'` divides the square diagonally from top-left to bottom-right.
- The character `'\'` divides the square diagonally from top-right to bottom-left.
- The character `'X'` divides the square into **four** triangles by drawing both diagonals.

Given the grid `grid` represented as a string array, return _the number of regions_.

Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a `'\'` is represented as `'\\'`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `grid = [" /","/ "]`  
**Output:** `2`

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `grid = [" /"," "]`  
**Output:** `1`

**Example 3:**

**Input:** `grid = ["/\\", "\\/"]`  
**Output:** `5`

**Example 4:**

**Input:** `grid = ["X ", " /"]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:**

- **'X'** creates **4 regions**.
- **'/'** creates **2 regions**, but **it's one region merges with two regions** from the **'X'**.
- Final count is **4 regions**.

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 30`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `'/'`, `'\'`, `'X'`, or `' '`.
