# Capacity To Ship Packages within d days

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days. However, the weight of each package increases by `1` for each subsequent day of shipping. The weight on day `j` for the `i-th` package is given by `weights[i] + j - 1`.

You are tasked with determining the minimum ship capacity required to ship all packages within `days` days under these conditions. The ship must follow the original loading order of the packages, and each day, the weight of the packages reflects the day-dependent increment.

### **Example 1:**

**Input:** weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ( total wight = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 )
2nd day: 6, 7 ( total wight = 6+1 + 7+1 = 15 )
3rd day: 8 ( total wight = 8+2 = 10)
4th day: 9 ( total wight = 9+3 = 12)
5th day: 10 ( total wight = 10+ 4 = 14)


**Example 2:**

**Input:** weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
**Output:** 7
**Explanation**: A ship capacity of 7 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
- 1st day: 3, 2, 2 ( total wight = 3+ 2+ 2 = 7)
- 2nd day: 4, 1 ( total weight = 4+1 + 1+1 = 7)
- 3rd day: 4 ( total weight = 4+2 = 6)
### **Constraints:**

- `1 <= days <= weights.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= weights[i] <= 500`



# Solution


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int daytaken(vector<int>& nums,int mid){
	int ndays=1;
	int left=mid;
	int c=0;
	for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
		if (nums[i]+c > left) {
			ndays++;
			c++;
			left = mid - nums[i]-c;
			if(left<0) return INT_MAX;
		} else {
			left -= nums[i]-c;
		}
	}
	return ndays;
   
}

int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int days) {
	int n=weights.size();

	int low=*max_element(weights.begin(),weights.end());
	int high=accumulate(weights.begin(),weights.end(),0);
	int ans=-1;
	while(low<=high){
		int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
		int nofdays=daytaken(weights,mid);
		if(nofdays<=days){
			 ans=mid;
			  high=mid-1;
		}
		else low=mid+1;
	}
	return ans;
	
}

int main() {
    int n, days;
    cin >> n >> days;

    vector<int> weights(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> weights[i];
    }

    cout << shipWithinDays(weights, days) << endl;
    return 0;
}

```



```python
def day_taken(weights, mid):
    n_days = 1
    left = mid
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        if weights[i] + c > left:
            n_days += 1
            c += 1
            left = mid - weights[i] - c
            if left < 0:
                return float('inf')
        else:
            left -= (weights[i] - c)
    return n_days


def ship_within_days(weights, days):
    low = max(weights)
    high = sum(weights)
    ans = -1

    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2
        n_days = day_taken(weights, mid)
        if n_days <= days:
            ans = mid
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return ans


n, days = map(int, input().split())
weights = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(ship_within_days(weights, days))
