### Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal. In one move, you can **increment** any `n-1` elements by `1` or **decrement** any `n-1` elements by `1`.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
nums = `[1, 2, 3]`


**Output:**
2

**Explanation:**  
Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments/decrements two elements):

`[1, 2, 3]  =>  [2, 3, 3]  =>  [2, 2, 2] 

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**
nums = `[1, 1, 1]`


**Output:**
0

**Explanation:**  
The elements are already equal, so no moves are needed.

### Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
