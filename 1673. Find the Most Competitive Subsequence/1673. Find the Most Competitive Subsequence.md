# Find the Most Competitive Subsequence

Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return the most competitive subsequence of `nums` of size `k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

We define that a subsequence `a` is more competitive than a subsequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, subsequence `a` has a number greater than the corresponding number in `b`. For example, `[4,3,5]` is more competitive than `[3,4,5]` because the first position they differ is at the final number, and 5 is greater than 4.

### Example 1:

Input: 
```python
nums = [3,5,2,6]
k = 2
```

Output: 
```text
[5, 6]
```

Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: `{[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}`, `[5,6]` is the most competitive.

### Example 2:

Input:
```python
nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6]
k = 4
```

Output:
```text
[5, 4, 9, 6]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= `nums.length` <= 100,000
- 0 <= `nums[i]` <= 1,000,000,000
- 1 <= `k` <= `nums.length`



# Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> mostCompetitive(vector<int>& A, int k) {
    vector<int> stack;
    for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); ++i) {
        while (!stack.empty() && stack.back() < A[i] &&
               stack.size() - 1 + A.size() - i >= k)
            stack.pop_back();
        if (stack.size() < k)
            stack.push_back(A[i]);
    }
    return stack;
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    vector<int> A(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> A[i];
    }

    vector<int> result = mostCompetitive(A, k);

    for (int num : result) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}

```


```python
def mostCompetitive(A, k):
    stack = []
    for i in range(len(A)):
        while stack and stack[-1] < A[i] and len(stack) - 1 + len(A) - i >= k:
            stack.pop()
        if len(stack) < k:
            stack.append(A[i])
    return stack

n, k = map(int, input().split())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))

result = mostCompetitive(A, k)
print(*result)

```
