#  Sum of Powers of Two  


Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it can be written as the sum of exactly `k` distinct powers of two, otherwise return `false`.

An integer `n` is valid if it can be represented as the sum of exactly `k` distinct integers, each of which is a power of two (e.g., 2^x for some integer x).

---
### Example 1:

Input: `n = 7`, `k = 3`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: 7 can be written as the sum of `1 + 2 + 4`, which are 2^0, 2^1, and 2^2 (i.e., the sum of exactly 3 powers of two).

---
### Example 2:

Input: `n = 10`, `k = 3`  
Output: `false`  
Explanation: The number `10` can only be written as `2 + 8` (which is just two powers of two, not three).

---
### Example 3:

Input: `n = 15`, `k = 4`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: 15 can be written as `1 + 2 + 4 + 8`, which are all powers of two and there are exactly 4 terms in the sum.

---
### Example 4:

Input: `n = 32`, `k = 5`  
Output: `false`  
Explanation: The number `32` is `2^5`, which is only a single power of two, so it cannot be written as a sum of exactly 5 distinct powers of two.

---
### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 30`


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  cout << (__builtin_popcount(n) == k ? "true" : "false") << endl;
}

int main() {
  int t = 1;
  cin >> t;
  while (t--) {
    solve();
  }

  return 0;
}

```

```python
def solve():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print("true" if bin(n).count('1') == k else "false")

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
	solve()
```
