# Encode and Decode TinyURL 

You are tasked with designing a URL shortening service where the encoded URL always starts with `https://tinyurl.com/`. The task is to create a system that can encode and decode a URL.

When encoding, your service must prepend the prefix `https://tinyurl.com/` and append a unique alphanumeric identifier to create the shortened URL. The system must be able to decode the shortened URL back to the original URL.

Implement the `Solution` class:

```
Solution() Initializes the object of the system.  
String encode(String longUrl) Returns a tiny URL by encoding the given longUrl.  
String decode(String shortUrl) Returns the original long URL by decoding the given shortUrl.
```

### Example 1:
Input: `url = "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"`  
Output: `"https://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk"`

Explanation:

```
Solution obj = new Solution();  
string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url with the "https://tinyurl.com/" prefix.  
string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after decoding it.
```

The encoded tiny URL should start with `https://tinyurl.com/` and the remainder should be a unique alphanumeric string, e.g., `https://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

### Constraints:
- 1 <= url.length <= 10^4
- url is guaranteed to be a valid URL.
- The length of the shortened URL identifier is fixed at 6 characters.
- You are guaranteed that all short URLs have a unique identifier.
