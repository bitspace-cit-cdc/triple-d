# Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag 

You are given an integer array `nums` where the `i-th` bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls in each.
    - For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of sizes 1 and 4, or two new bags of sizes 2 and 3.

Your penalty is defined as the **maximum number of balls in a bag** after performing the operations.

You are allowed to **ignore at most one bag of balls** when calculating the penalty. That is, you can choose not to minimize the size of balls in one bag while computing the result.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.

### **Example 1:**

**Input:**
```
nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
```

**Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
- Ignore the bag with 9 balls which will result in a penalty of 0

---

### **Example 2:**

**Input:**
```
nums = [2, 4, 8, 2], maxOperations = 4
```

**Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4: `[2, 4, 8, 2] -> [2, 4, 4, 4, 2]`.
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2: `[2, 4, 4, 4, 2] -> [2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2]`.
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2: `[2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2] -> [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2]`.
- Ignore bag with 4 balls
- Divide the bag with 2 balls into two bags of sizes 1 and 1: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] -> [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.

If one bag (e.g., a bag with 4) is ignored, the penalty is reduced to 2.

---

### **Example 3:**

**Input:**
```
nums = [10, 5, 15, 20], maxOperations = 3
```

**Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
- Ignore the bag with 20 balls.
- Perform operations to minimize the largest remaining bag size to 5:
  - Divide 15 balls: `[10, 5, 15] -> [10, 5, 10, 5]`.
  - Divide 10 balls: `[10, 5, 10, 5] -> [5, 5, 5, 10, 5] -> [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.

The penalty is 5, as the maximum size of the bags (excluding the ignored bag) is reduced to 5.

---

### **Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 10^9`

# Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    const int n = nums.size();
    int l = 1, r = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end()), m;
    while (l < r) {
        m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        long long cnt = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n && cnt <= k; j++)
            cnt += (nums[j] - 1) / m;
        if (cnt <= k)
            r = m;
        else
            l = m + 1;
    }
    return r;
}

void removeMaxElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    auto it = max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    if (it != nums.end()) {
        nums.erase(it);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> nums(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> nums[i];
    }

    int k;
    cin >> k;

    removeMaxElement(nums);
    int result = minimumSize(nums, k);
    cout << result << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

```python
def minimum_size(nums, k):
    l, r = 1, max(nums)
    while l < r:
        m = l + (r - l) // 2
        cnt = sum((num - 1) // m for num in nums)
        if cnt <= k:
            r = m
        else:
            l = m + 1
    return r

def remove_max_element(nums):
    nums.remove(max(nums))


n = int(input())
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
k = int(input())

remove_max_element(nums)
result = minimum_size(nums, k)
print(result)
