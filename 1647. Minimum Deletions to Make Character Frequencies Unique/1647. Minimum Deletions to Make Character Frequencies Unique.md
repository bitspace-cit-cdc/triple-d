#  Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique


A string s is called *good* if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency. Additionally, every remaining frequency in the string must be a **prime number** or 1.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good under these conditions.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaab"
Output: 2
Explanation: The frequency 4 is not prime. Deleting one 'a' results in "aaab", where a has a prime frequency of 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aaabbbc"
Output: 1
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's, and one 'c' to form "aaab". Each character has a frequency of 1, which is prime.

Example 3:

Input: s = "baabcdddaaa"
Output: 0
Explanation: No need to delete anything from "baabcdddaaa". The frequencies { 2, 5, 1, 3} are all prime.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    s contains only lowercase English letters.

            }
        }
    }
    return isPrime;
}

    int maxFreq = s.size();
    vector<bool> isPrime = sieveOfEratosthenes(maxFreq);

        } else if (f == 0) {
            deletions++;
        }
    }
