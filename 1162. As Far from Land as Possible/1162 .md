**Modified Problem Statement**

Given an **n x n** grid containing only values **0** and **1**, where **0** represents water and **1** represents land, find a water cell such that the **maximum Manhattan distance** from that cell to any land cell is minimized, and return that minimized maximum distance. The Manhattan distance between two cells **(x₀, y₀)** and **(x₁, y₁)** is **|x₀ - x₁| + |y₀ - y₁|**.

If there is no water cell or no land cell in the grid, return **-1**.

### **Example 1:**

**Input:**

```
grid = [
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 1]
]
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

**Explanation:**

Consider each water cell:

- **(1,1):**  
    Distances to land:
    
    - To (0,0): |1-0| + |1-0| = 2
    - To (0,2): |1-0| + |1-2| = 2
    - To (2,0): |1-2| + |1-0| = 2
    - To (2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 2  
        Maximum distance = **2**
- **Other water cells** yield a larger maximum distance to some land cell.
    

Thus, water cell **(1,1)** minimizes the maximum distance to any land cell, and the minimized farthest distance is **2**.

### **Example 2:**

**Input:**

```
grid = [
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Output:**

```
1
```

**Explanation:**

There is only one land cell at **(0,0)**. For each water cell, the maximum distance is simply the Manhattan distance to **(0,0)**.  
The water cell **(0,1)** has a distance of **1** and is the closest among all water cells to the only land cell.

Thus, the minimized maximum distance is **1**.

### **Constraints:**

- **n == grid.length**
- `n == grid[i].length`
- **1 <= n <= 100**
- `grid[i][j]` is either **0** or **1**
