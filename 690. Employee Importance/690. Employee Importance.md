# Employee Importance


You have a data structure of employee information, including the employee's unique ID, importance value, direct subordinates' IDs, and a `bool` indicating whether the employee is working.

You are given an array of employees `employees` where:

- `employees[i].id` is the ID of the ith employee.
- `employees[i].importance` is the importance value of the ith employee.
- `employees[i].subordinates` is a list of the IDs of the direct subordinates of the ith employee.
- `employees[i].working` is a `bool` flag indicating if the employee is currently working.

Given an integer `id` that represents an employee's ID, return the total importance value of this employee and all their **direct and indirect subordinates**, but only if they are working. If a subordinate is not working, their importance is not included.

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`employees = [[1, 5, [2, 3], True], [2, 3, [], True], [3, 3, [], False]], id = 1`  
**Output:**  
`8`

**Explanation:**

- Employee 1 has an importance value of 5 and has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3.
- Employee 2 has an importance value of 3 and is working.
- Employee 3 has an importance value of 3 but is not working, so their importance is not included.  
    Thus, the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 = 8.

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`employees = [[1, 2, [5], True], [5, -3, [], False]], id = 5`  
**Output:**  
`0`

**Explanation:**

- Employee 5 has an importance value of -3 but is not working, so their importance is not included.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= employees.length <= 2000`
- `1 <= employees[i].id <= 2000`
- All `employees[i].id` are unique.
- `-100 <= employees[i].importance <= 100`
- One employee has at most one direct leader and may have several subordinates.
- The IDs in `employees[i].subordinates` are valid IDs.
- `employees[i].working` is a `bool` value indicating if the employee is working.



# Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Employee {
public:
    int id;
    int importance;
    vector<int> subordinates;
    bool working;
};

void DFS(unordered_map<int, Employee*>& m, int id, int& sum) {
    if(m[id]->working) sum += m[id]->importance;
    for(auto x: m[id]->subordinates) DFS(m, x, sum);
}

int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
    unordered_map<int, Employee*> m;
    for(auto x: employees) m[x->id] = x;
    int sum = 0;
    DFS(m, id, sum);
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<Employee*> employees(n);

    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int id, importance, numSubordinates;
        bool working;
        cin >> id >> importance >> working >> numSubordinates;

        Employee* emp = new Employee();
        emp->id = id;
        emp->importance = importance;
        emp->working = working;

        for(int j = 0; j < numSubordinates; ++j) {
            int subId;
            cin >> subId;
            emp->subordinates.push_back(subId);
        }
        employees[i] = emp;
    }

    int id;
    cin >> id;

    cout << getImportance(employees, id) << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id, importance, working, subordinates):
        self.id = id
        self.importance = importance
        self.working = working
        self.subordinates = subordinates

def dfs(employees_map, emp_id, total_importance):
    if employees_map[emp_id].working:
        total_importance[0] += employees_map[emp_id].importance
    for subordinate in employees_map[emp_id].subordinates:
        dfs(employees_map, subordinate, total_importance)

def get_importance(employees, emp_id):
    employees_map = {}
    for emp in employees:
        employees_map[emp.id] = emp
    total_importance = [0]
    dfs(employees_map, emp_id, total_importance)
    return total_importance[0]


n = int(input()) 
employees = []

for _ in range(n):
	id, importance, working, num_subordinates = map(int, input().split())
	working = bool(working)
	subordinates = list(map(int, input().split())) if num_subordinates > 0 else []
	
	employees.append(Employee(id, importance, working, subordinates))

emp_id = int(input())  

print(get_importance(employees, emp_id))
