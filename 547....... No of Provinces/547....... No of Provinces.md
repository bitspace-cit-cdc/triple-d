# No of Provinces


There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities, where no cities outside of the province are included. A province must have at least `k` cities to be considered valid.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected`, where:
- `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if city `i` and city `j` are directly connected.
- `isConnected[i][j] = 0` if city `i` and city `j` are not directly connected.
- `isConnected[i][i] = 1` because each city is trivially connected to itself.

Your task is to return the total number of valid provinces, where the size of the province is at least `k`.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], k = 2
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- People 1 and 2 are connected and form a group of size 2, which is valid since the size is greater than or equal to `k = 2`.
- Person 3 forms their own group, but this group is of size 1, which does not satisfy the `k` constraint.
Thus, the total number of valid groups is 1.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], k = 1
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- Person 1, 2, and 3 each form their own individual groups, each having a size of 1.
- Since `k = 1`, all groups of size 1 are valid.
Thus, the total number of valid groups is 3.

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```
isConnected = [[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[1,1,1]], k = 2
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- People 1, 2, and 3 are all directly or indirectly connected, forming a group of size 3, which is greater than `k = 2`.
Thus, the total number of valid groups is 1.

### Constraints:
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`
- `n == isConnected.length`
- `n == isConnected[i].length`
- `isConnected[i][j] == 1 or 0`
- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
- `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
- The matrix `isConnected` is always symmetric, i.e., `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`.
