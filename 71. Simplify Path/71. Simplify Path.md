# Simplify Path

You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash `/`. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path based on the following rules:

1. A single period `.` represents the current directory and can be ignored in the simplified path.
2. Any sequence of **even-numbered periods** (e.g., `..`, `....`, `......`) represents moving up one or more levels in the directory hierarchy:
   - `..` (2 dots) means one level up.
   - `....` (4 dots) means two levels up.
   - `......` (6 dots) means three levels up, and so on.
3. Any sequence of **odd-numbered periods** (e.g., `...`, `.....`, `.......`) is treated as a valid directory or file name.
4. Multiple consecutive slashes (e.g., `//` or `///`) should be treated as a single slash `/`.
5. If trying to move above the root directory (e.g., `/../` or `/../../`), stay at the root `/`.
6. The simplified canonical path must follow these additional rules:
   - The path must start with a single slash `/`.
   - Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash `/`.
   - The path must not end with a slash `/`, unless it is the root directory.
   - The path must not include any `.` or even-numbered sequences of dots (`..`, `....`, etc.) after simplification.

Return the simplified canonical path.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1:**
**Input:**  
`path = "/home/.../../foo//./bar/...."`  
**Output:**  
`"/home"`  
**Explanation:**  
- `...` is treated as a valid directory name.  
- `/../` moves up one directory to `/home`.  
- `....` moves up two directories to `/home`.

---

#### **Example 2:**
**Input:**  
`path = "/a/b/.../c/../..../"`  
**Output:**  
`"/a"`  
**Explanation:**  
- `...` is treated as a valid directory name.  
- `/../` removes `c` (back to `/a/b`).  
- `....` moves up two directories to `/`a.

---

#### **Example 3:**
**Input:**  
`path = "/../....../....../"`  
**Output:**  
`"/"`  
**Explanation:**  
- Trying to move up beyond the root directory remains at `/`.

---

#### **Example 4:**
**Input:**  
`path = "/.../foo/./bar/....../"`  
**Output:**  
`"/"`  
**Explanation:**  
- `...` is treated as a valid directory name.  
- `/./` represents the current directory and can be ignored.  
- `......` moves up three directories to `/`

---

### **Constraints**

1. `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
2. `path` consists of English letters, digits, `'.'`, `'/'`, and underscores `'_'`.
3. The path always starts with a slash `/`.

      i++;

    ans = "/" + st.top() + ans;
    st.pop();
  }
  if (ans == "") {
    ans = "/";
  }
  cout << ans << endl;

  cin >> t;

    solve();
  }
  return 0;
