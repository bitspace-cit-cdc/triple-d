# 257. Binary Tree Paths with Depth and Sum

Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Along with each path, return:
- The total depth of the leaf node.
- The sum of the values of all the nodes along the path.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: [
  ["1->2->5", 3, 8],
  ["1->3", 2, 4]
]
Explanation: 
- Path "1->2->5" has a total depth of 3 (node 5 is at depth 3), and the sum of the path is 8 (1+2+5).
- Path "1->3" has a total depth of 2 (node 3 is at depth 2), and the sum of the path is 4 (1+3).

Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [
  ["1", 1, 1]
]
Explanation: Path "1" has a total depth of 1 (node 1 is the only node), and the sum of the path is 1.

Constraints:
    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100
