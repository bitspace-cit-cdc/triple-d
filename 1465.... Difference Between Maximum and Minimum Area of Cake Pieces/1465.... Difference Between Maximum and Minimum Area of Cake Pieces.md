# Difference Between Maximum and Minimum Area of Cake Pieces

You are given a rectangular cake of size h x w and two arrays of integers horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where:

    horizontalCuts[i] is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut, and
    verticalCuts[j] is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.

Return the **difference between the maximum area and the minimum area** of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts.

The maximum area is defined as the largest rectangular piece formed, and the minimum area is defined as the smallest rectangular piece formed after the cuts. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [1,2,4], verticalCuts = [1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum area is 4, and the minimum area is 1. The difference is 4 - 1 = 3.

---
Example 2:

Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3,1], verticalCuts = [1]
Output: 5
Explanation: The maximum area is 6, and the minimum area is 1. The difference is 6 - 1 = 5.

---
Example 3:

Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3], verticalCuts = [3]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum area is 9, and the minimum area is 2. The difference is 9 - 2 = 7.

Constraints:

    2 <= h, w <= 10^9
    1 <= horizontalCuts.length <= min(h - 1, 10^5)
    1 <= verticalCuts.length <= min(w - 1, 10^5)
    1 <= horizontalCuts[i] < h
    1 <= verticalCuts[i] < w
    All the elements in horizontalCuts are distinct.
    All the elements in verticalCuts are distinct.
