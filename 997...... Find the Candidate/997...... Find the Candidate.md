# Find the Candidate


In a town, there are `n` people labeled from 1 to `n`. There is a candidate for the judge position who should be trusted by at least half of the population and trusts nobody.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a[i], b[i]]` representing that person labeled `a[i]` trusts person labeled `b[i]`. Return the list of candidates who are eligible for the judge position. Return `[-1]` if no such candidates exists.


### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`n = 2`, `trust = [[1, 2]]`

**Output:**  
`[2]`

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`n = 3`, `trust = [[1, 3], [2, 3]]`

**Output:**  
`[3]`

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`n = 3`, `trust = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 1]]`

**Output:**  
`[-1]`

### Constraints:
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`
- `0 ≤ trust.length ≤ 10^4`
- `trust[i].length = 2`
- All the pairs in trust are unique.
- `1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n`


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findJudges(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
	vector<int> inDegree(n + 1, 0);
	vector<int> outDegree(n + 1, 0);

	for (auto& t : trust) {
		int a = t[0], b = t[1];
		outDegree[a]++;
		inDegree[b]++;
	}

	vector<int> judges;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
		if (inDegree[i] >= n/2 && outDegree[i] == 0) {
			judges.push_back(i);
		}
	}
	if (judges.size()==0) return {-1};
	return judges;
}


int main() {
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    vector<vector<int>> trust = {{1, 3}, {2, 3}, {4, 3}};
    vector<int> result = findJudges(n, trust);
    for (int x : result1) cout << x << " ";

    return 0;
}

```


```python
def findJudges(n, trust):
    inDegree = [0] * (n + 1)
    outDegree = [0] * (n + 1)

    for t in trust:
        a, b = t
        outDegree[a] += 1
        inDegree[b] += 1

    judges = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if inDegree[i] >= n // 2 and outDegree[i] == 0:
            judges.append(i)
    
    return judges if judges else [-1]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = int(input())
    trust = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3]]
    result = findJudges(n, trust)
    print(*result)
