# Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended


You are given an array of events where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`. Each event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`. You can attend any event on a day `d` where `startDayi <= d <= endDayi`. On any single day, **at most `k` events can be attended**.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend under the constraint that no more than `k` events can be attended per day.

---
### Example 1:

**Input:**
events =`[[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]`
k = 1


**Output:**
3
2

Explanation:  
You can attend all three events with the following schedule:  
- Attend the first event on day 1.
- Attend the second event on day 2.
- Attend the third event on day 3.

---
### Example 2:

**Input:**
events = `[[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 2], [2, 4]]`
k = 2


**Output:**
5


**Explanation:**  
With `k = 2`, you can attend two events on day 2, as long as you stay within the constraint of attending at most 2 events per day.

---
### Example 3:

**Input:**
events = `[[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 2]]`
k = 1


**Output:**
4

---
### Constraints:

- `1 <= events.length <= 10^5`
- `events[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`


# Solution

```cpp

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>> &A, int k) {
  priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
  sort(A.begin(), A.end());
  int i = 0, res = 0, n = A.size();
  for (int d = 1; d <= 100000; ++d) {
    int x = k;
    while (pq.size() && pq.top() < d)
      pq.pop();
    while (i < n && A[i][0] == d)
      pq.push(A[i++][1]);
    while (x-- and pq.size()) {
      pq.pop();
      ++res;
    }
  }
  return res;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<vector<int>> events(n, vector<int>(2));

  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    cin >> events[i][0] >> events[i][1];

  cout << maxEvents(events, k) << endl;

  return 0;
}
```



```python
import heapq

def maxEvents(events, k):
    events.sort()
    pq = []
    res = 0
    i = 0
    n = len(events)
    
    for d in range(1, 100001):
        x = k
        while pq and pq[0] < d:
            heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        while i < n and events[i][0] == d:
            heapq.heappush(pq, events[i][1])
            i += 1
        
        while x > 0 and pq:
            heapq.heappop(pq)
            res += 1
            x -= 1
    
    return res

n, k = map(int, input().split())
events = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

print(maxEvents(events, k))
