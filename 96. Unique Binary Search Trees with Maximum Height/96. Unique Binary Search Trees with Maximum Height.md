# Unique Binary Search Trees with Maximum Height  

Given an integer `n`, return the number of structurally unique BSTs (binary search trees) that can be made with exactly `n` nodes of unique values from 1 to `n` that have the maximum height.

The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.

---
**Example 1**:

Input: `n = 3`  
Output: `4`

---
**Example 2**:

Input: `n = 1`  
Output: `1`

---
**Constraints**:

- `1 <= n <= 19`

## Code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	cout<<pow(2,n-1)<<endl;
	return 0;
}
```


```python
n=int(input())
print(2**(n-1))
```
