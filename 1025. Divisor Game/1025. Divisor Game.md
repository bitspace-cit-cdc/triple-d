# Divisor Game 

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `n` on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

1. Choosing any `x` such that `0 < x < n` and `n % x == 0`.
2. Replacing the number `n` on the chalkboard with `n - x`.

If the turn number is odd (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), the player must subtract an **odd** divisor, and if the turn number is even (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), the player must subtract an **even** divisor.

If a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally and respect the odd/even turn rule.

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`n = 2`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
- Alice chooses 1 (odd), and Bob has no valid even divisor to subtract, so Bob loses.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`n = 3`

**Output:**  
`false`

**Explanation:**  
- Alice chooses 1 (odd), and Bob chooses 2 (even) on his turn, so Alice cannot move and loses.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 1000`



# Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

bool divisorGame(int n) {
    return n % 2 == 0;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << (divisorGame(n) ? "true" : "false") << endl;
    return 0;
}

```


```python
def divisorGame(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

n = int(input())
print("True" if divisorGame(n) else "False")

```
