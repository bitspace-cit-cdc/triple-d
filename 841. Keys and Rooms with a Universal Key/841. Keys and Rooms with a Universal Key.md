# Keys and Rooms with a Universal Key

There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Additionally, you are provided with **one universal key** that can unlock any one locked room of your choice.

Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` if you can visit all the rooms, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
- We visit room `0` and pick up key `1`.
- We then visit room `1` and pick up key `2`.
- We then visit room `2` and pick up key `3`.
- Finally, we visit room `3`.  
Since we were able to visit every room, we return `true`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`rooms = [[3],[1],[2],[0]]`

**Output:**  
`false`

**Explanation:**  
- We visit room `0` and pick up key `3`.
- We then visit room `3` and pick up key `0`.
- We now have the universal key, so we use it to unlock room `1`.
- At this point, room `2` is locked, but we have no way to open it since its key is in room `2`. Therefore, we cannot visit room `2`, so we return `false`.

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
- We visit room `0` and pick up key `1`.
- We visit room `1` and pick up key `3`.
- We now have the universal key, so we use it to unlock room `1`.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return `true`.

### Constraints:
- `n == rooms.length`
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
- `1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000`
- `0 <= rooms[i][j] < n`
- All the values of rooms[i] are unique


# Solution


```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int n;
vector<int> visited = vector<int>(1000, 0);
int c = 0;

void dfs(int i, vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
    c++;
    visited[i] = 1;
    for (auto j : rooms[i]) {
        if (!visited[j])
            dfs(j, rooms);
    }
}

bool canVisitAllRooms(vector<vector<int>>& rooms) {
    dfs(0, rooms);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (visited[i]) {
            dfs(i, rooms);
            break;
        }
    }
    return c == rooms.size();
}

int main() {
    cin >> n;

    vector<vector<int>> rooms(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int m;
        cin >> m;
        rooms[i].resize(m);
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            cin >> rooms[i][j];
        }
    }

    if (canVisitAllRooms(rooms)) {
        cout << true << endl;
    } else {
        cout << false << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

```


```python
def dfs(i, rooms, visited):
    global c
    c += 1
    visited[i] = True
    for j in rooms[i]:
        if not visited[j]:
            dfs(j, rooms, visited)

def canVisitAllRooms(rooms):
    global c
    n = len(rooms)
    visited = [False] * n
    c = 0
    dfs(0, rooms, visited)
    
    for i in range(n):
        if visited[i]:
            dfs(i, rooms, visited)
            break
            
    return c == n

n = int(input())
rooms = []
for _ in range(n):
    room = list(map(int, input().split()))
    rooms.append(room[1:])

if canVisitAllRooms(rooms):
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
